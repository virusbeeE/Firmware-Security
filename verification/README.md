# Verification

Verification of mitigations is currently being developed for operating systems and applications.

## Windows
Verification of Windows operating system and application mitigations are being developed as custom Nessus audit files. Custom audit files can be leveraged by using a [Policy Compliance](https://docs.tenable.com/nessus/7_0/Content/ScanAndPolicyTemplates.htm) scan in Nessus. DoD components can acquire Nessus via the [ACAS](https://www.disa.mil/cybersecurity/network-defense/acas) program.

See the [Windows page](./windows/README.md) for more information.
